# Complex sidebars, make the next action obvious

**edition 2026-09-07 · rev 2**

Someone opens a vault to sign in, choose another account, copy a field, or
change an entry. They should see the right identity quickly, act without
precision pointing, and return to the page with their place intact.

![Vault study: setup occupying every page versus a task-first account list](%ASSETS%/vault-study.svg)

## What is wrong, and what is known

The rejected study is reconstructed from a reported vault layout and source
inspection on 2026-09-05. A shadow capture confirmed repeated generic globe
bubbles, small metadata, and a long list competing with sync and explanatory
chrome. In that captured state the shadow had no active website context, so
the passkey enrollment card was absent. Do not describe that image as proof
of the card's height on a site. The inspected row measured 264 × 38 CSS px,
with 12 px text and a 15 px SVG icon; its generic icon bubble was 26 px.
This is one measured desktop state, not a universal size across themes.

The source inserts passkey setup before every tab's content. For a site with
no stored passkey, a card explains browser internals and asks for enrollment.
That spends the same vertical space during unrelated jobs, including viewing
or editing an entry. A healthy subsystem should not need a standing tutorial.
An error should explain the consequence and offer a repair at the relevant
point; technical details can be disclosed on demand.

The login row replaces identity with credential type: key for passkey, globe
otherwise. That makes unrelated sites look alike and makes the same site's
identity change when its credential changes. Use the site's favicon in a
stable identity slot, with a letter fallback; show Password/Passkey as a
separate quiet label. A favicon helps recognition but never proves the origin.
Keep the actual site and account text legible alongside it.

## Give each level one job

The header identifies the vault and exposes search and Add. The list starts
with accounts matching the current site, with an explicit “All items” route.
A row has a 24 px identity image, a readable site/name, a secondary account
line, a credential label, and a visible Fill action when applicable. Its body
opens details. These actions have different labels and hit regions; clicking
Copy must not also open the item or fill a page.

Use 36 px action targets and roughly 56–64 px two-line rows as the initial
desktop design target. Increase for touch; test at the user's real scale.
More rows on screen is useful only while a person can distinguish and hit
them. An 18 px symbol may be readable inside a 36 px button; the symbol itself
must not be the whole click target.

Details replace the list in the same rail with a labeled Back action. Back
restores the search, scroll and selected account. Editing is an explicit step;
Save remains reachable at the bottom, errors appear at the relevant fields,
and Cancel returns to the entry. No permanent partitions are repeated inside
every sliding page. Reserve a compact footer for vault-wide lock/sync state.

Passkey enrollment belongs to a site task or entry details. Offer “Set up a
passkey” where it is meaningful. If a page must reopen, say what will happen
and preserve the user's context; do not expose “shim,” “arm,” or browser API
names as the primary explanation. Enrollment never means a passkey has been
created, and a proposed UX must preserve the existing user-presence ceremony.

## Count actions from a stated starting point

| Task, with the vault already open | Proposed mouse path | Keyboard intent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fill a matching account | Fill on the matching row: 1 click | Select account, invoke labeled Fill |
| Inspect an account | Row body: 1 click | Arrow to row, Enter |
| Copy password | Row menu then Copy password: 2 clicks | Row menu shortcut, named command |
| Change an account | Row, Edit, Save: 3 clicks excluding typing | Enter, Edit, fields, Save |
| Return to results | Back: 1 click, previous place restored | Escape from details, focus restored |

These are acceptance targets, not measured speedups. Compare against a
recorded current path using the same starting state. Never optimize click
count by removing an intentional confirmation or by making the row's action
ambiguous. Destructive work stays separated from frequent work.

## Work through one account, not a gallery of controls

Fixture: two invented accounts at example.test, Personal and Work. Give both
the same site mark; give them different account names and credential labels.
This is the recognition test: the favicon narrows the site, while the account
line distinguishes which identity will be used. Never rely on color alone.

1. Open matching accounts. Locate Work without opening either entry.
2. Open Work's details, then go Back. The same result, search text and scroll
   position must remain, with focus on Work rather than the top of the rail.
3. Invoke Fill explicitly. Report success only after the fill operation
   confirms its outcome. A request being sent is not completion.
4. Simulate failure. Keep the selected account and offer the relevant retry
   or alternative; do not return to an empty list or lose the page context.
5. Change the page's origin while details are open. Re-evaluate where Fill
   would act; never silently apply an old match to a new destination.

This is a proposed acceptance walkthrough, not a claim that the miniature
implements browser matching, credential storage or authentication. The
staging study covers search, the matching-first list, the All-items route,
details/back with focus restoration, and fill with a reported outcome, it
does not touch a real vault, clipboard or network.

| State | Helpful next action | Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No matching account | Say which site was searched; offer All items or Add | A blank rail or a large passkey setup tutorial |
| Vault locked | One clear Unlock action; preserve the pending task | Displaying an apparently usable Fill control |
| Missing favicon | Stable letter fallback plus visible site text | A broken image or a credential icon masquerading as site identity |
| Long account name | Preserve the distinguishing part; expose the full name in details | Shrinking all account text to fit the longest entry |
| Unsaved edit, Back requested | Explicitly resolve the draft before leaving | Silent discard or a surprise save |
| Sync failed | Distinguish saved locally from synchronized; offer retry | A generic success label that conceals the failure |

Account data and icons must not introduce a new privacy leak. Reuse the
browser's existing site-icon policy/cache rather than contacting an arbitrary
third-party favicon service as a side effect of opening the vault.

## The specimen

**Specimen** `ydesign/complex-sidebars@2026-09-07-r1`, registry:
`specimens/specimens.json`; source: `specimens/src/lib.rs` (`VaultStudy`) +
`specimens/src/main.rs`; build: `bash scripts/build-specimens.sh`.

The staging study runs the walkthrough with invented entries only. The
fixtures are the recognition test itself: two accounts on example.test
(Personal with a passkey, Work with a password), a non-matching pair, and a
deliberately long address for the wrap test. Identity slots come in BOTH
states, a stable invented favicon square for two accounts, the letter
fallback for the other two, never a credential icon standing in for the
site. Row semantics are clean: the row is a noninteractive container with a
separate Open region and a separate Fill button, so clicking Fill never also
opens the entry. Matches are DERIVED from the current page: an inspector
control changes the origin, every match and Fill offer re-evaluate, and a
stale match is refused rather than silently applied. Fill reports its outcome
in an aria-live line; a simulated failure keeps the selection and the page
while naming what happened. Details replace the list with a labeled Back, and
keyboard Escape shares the SAME restoration path, the search, the narrowed
list, and focus on the entry you came from. A search that matches nothing
offers the explicit All-items route instead of a blank rail. Reset restores
the query, origin, selection, outcome, failure toggle and critique draft.

An in-host schema exercise (rows inside yggterm) mirrors the open/return
moves with the shared row renderer; it is the rail's exercise, not the
vault's.

## Verification, not decoration

Try two accounts on one site, a missing favicon, a long email, no matches,
a locked vault, stale sync, a failed fill, keyboard-only use, 200% zoom and a
narrow rail. Readability, target size and focus matter for everyone: fatigue,
trackpad imprecision and divided attention are ordinary operating conditions.
Search and per-site matching should reduce choices before typography is shrunk.

The staging study covers the listed-or-stated states above that a UI study
can carry (matching, no-match, failed fill, long names, keyboard and focus);
locked-vault, stale-sync and unsaved-edit states remain prose until their
component study grows them. Shared row rendering and actual vault flows
require their own implementation and live proof.
