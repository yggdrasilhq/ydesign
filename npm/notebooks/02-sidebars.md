# Sidebars — the canonical patterns

A sidebar is the most-copied surface in the fleet and the easiest to get
subtly wrong, because every mistake is small: a pixel of indent here, a dot
in the wrong column there. The patterns below are the canonical answers.
Build yours from them; compare against them by screenshot.

## The row vocabulary

Every session-style list row is ONE anatomy, drawn by ONE engine:

```
[indent] [status-dot] [icon] [title (+subtitle)] [badge] [actions]
```

- **Two densities, one typography.** `Sidebar` (the main tree: 20px icon box,
  9px status column, indent base/step 12px) and `Rail` (app panes: padding
  5/8, radius 8, indent base 8/step 19, ONE mark column). Font, size and
  icon-box geometry are IDENTICAL across densities — a rail that reads as a
  smaller font is a defect, not a density.
- **The empty slot is still laid out.** A row with no dot still reserves the
  status column, so an appearing dot never shoves titles sideways and two
  rows never start their text at different x.
- **The title track is the whole row.** Trailing actions are in flow and
  `display:none` at rest; the row reveals them on hover, on selection, and
  on focus-within — all three triggers, because a keyboard-reached row must
  show its verbs too.
- ⛔ **No background behind the revealed verbs.** Not a chip, not a fade, not
  a blur. The reflow — the title ellipsizing to make room — is the point.
- **Folders above loose rows, at every level.** Organization first, then the
  working set. A group row wears a FILLED folder glyph when open, an outline
  one when shut, plus the always-visible disclosure chevron in its trailing
  slot. Expand/collapse is never hover-to-discover.
- **Renaming happens in place**, in the row, with the existing text selected.

## The status vocabulary (one light system)

| Colour | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `GREEN` | durable — survives the app (a kept session, a saved file) |
| `BLUE` | transient — lives only while the app does (an unkept session, an unsaved draft) |
| `AMBER` | attention — recovery in progress, degraded, **written-to and unanswered**; steady, never blinking |
| `RED` | reserved — dead/unrecoverable |
| blink | an orthogonal modifier meaning *working right now* |

- The app names a **class** (`durable`/`transient`); the host owns the
  colour. A status token the host does not paint renders the empty slot —
  never a guessed colour.
- ⛔ Status never lives in the title. A `●` glyph in the name paints in the
  text colour and shifts the name; if a row needs to signal, it has a slot.
- **One clock for every blink**, app-wide: a single 2400 ms square wave that
  every indicator joins by marker. Dots pulsing in unison read as one system;
  random phases read as noise.

## Sidebar partitioning (the pattern with intent)

A well-partitioned sidebar (the yedit files rail is the reference) has three
partitions and no more:

1. **Top partition — the knobs.** Small, ≤ 30% of the rail's height: identity
   row, tool buttons, the search field, a segmented control, at most a couple
   of toggles. Everything here is a *control for the list below*.
2. **The majority — the list.** The rows, unbroken by cards. A file tree, a
   tab rail, a notebook shelf: no section cards around a long list — that is
   the nested-boxes look the brand rules out by name.
3. **The pinned footer — the status line.** Counts, modes, the word count.
   Behind a separator, never scrolling with the list.

A sidebar that mixes these — prose paragraphs beside toggles, a toolbar
grafted onto a list with no heading voice — reads broken even when every
individual row is fine. When a rail feels wrong, check the partitions before
touching any row.

## Header anatomy (the top of a rail, in order)

1. Title row — the rail's name and its leading verb (`FILES` `+`).
2. Tool row — search, segmented control, icon buttons. One row, aligned to
   the row grid beneath.
3. Section heading — 10px, weight 800, uppercase, tracked ~0.07em, in the
   TEXT colour (not muted-on-muted).

A header that skips the heading voice and floats controls directly above a
list is the single most common app-sidebar defect. The fix is structure, not
spacing: give the controls a row and the list a name.

## Chrome behaviour that is not optional

- **A hidden sidebar is an auto-hide sidebar**: a thin hover strip on its own
  edge, revealing over the workspace on the z axis as a floating island —
  inset card, rounded, soft shadow on every side, radius matching the
  viewport. There is no settings toggle for "hidden means gone".
- **A reveal never resizes the workspace.** The revealed panel is out of
  flow; the terminal keeps its exact grid before, during and after.
- **Each rail resizes from its inner edge**, with its own clamp and its own
  persisted width.
- **When a rail is hidden, the workspace runs flush to that edge.** No stale
  gutters; a preserved gap reads as a layout bug.
- **Mirror flips the arrangement, never a control's internals.** The search
  box is the axis and never moves; window buttons stay where the platform
  put them; content is never mirrored.

## Proving a sidebar change

1. Rebuild, install, open the surface.
2. `server app screenshot` (faithful backend for DOM surfaces).
3. Compare against the specimens: row grid, status column line, title track,
   partition proportions, heading voice.
4. Fix at the engine, re-shoot. A screenshot pair (before/after) is the
   acceptance artefact.
