# Forms & settings

Forms are where a design language is most visible and most often broken,
because a form is nothing but decisions repeated: every field, every label,
every button is a fresh chance to drift. The rules here collapse those
decisions into defaults.

Start with a concrete job: change a setting, understand its consequence, and
continue. Keep the label, control and brief help together. Long explanations
belong in an accessible details disclosure when they are necessary to decide;
a tooltip must not be the only way keyboard or touch users learn a consequence.

## Section cards: a form is a card, a list is not

A form group — heading plus the fields under it — sits in a card (14px
radius, inset hairline, 11–12px padding). **Opt-in per section, and it stays
opt-in**: a card around a long list is a stack of nested boxes, which the
brand rules out by name. A form wants the card; a file tree does not.

- The heading is the structural voice: 10px, 800, uppercase, tracked, in the
  TEXT colour. Muted-on-muted headings are what made long settings read as
  one undifferentiated slab.
- A form's primary action is **pinned**, not scrolled: in a rail, Save lives
  in the footer bar and wears the accent (`primary: true`).

## The short-phrase rule ⭐

This exists because of a measured defect: settings rows whose explanatory
prose sat **beside** the control as a five-to-seven-line paragraph, eating
the row's width, leaving the toggle stranded in dead space, and making the
whole rail read as a document with buttons in it.

The rule:

- **One short phrase, under the control it explains.** Muted, ~10.5px, never
  a paragraph. If more explanation is needed, offer a labeled disclosure;
  a concise tooltip may supplement it.
- **Never beside.** Prose to the left of a toggle with a dead gap between is
  the exact failure shape. Under, demoted, or nothing.
- The proportion test: the control should dominate its row. If the
  explanation occupies more visual weight than the control, the row is wrong.

The same law in menus: a verb's *reason* lives in the **tooltip**, never in
the label — a label is a name, and appending a justification to it produced
unreadable menus once already.

## One field skin

There is ONE text field in the product; every box is that control wearing
different geometry. The skin is a **stylesheet** (hover and focus are states;
an inline style cannot express one), and the style function emits the BOX —
never the fill, because one inline background out-specifies the stylesheet
and silently kills hover and focus for that surface.

- Resting, hover and focus fills derive from the theme accent; the hairline
  is inset 1px; the focus ring is the dialog ring's vocabulary (2px accent,
  2px outside, following the control's radius).
- The pill shape is reserved: the browser omnibox and the find bar, which
  mimic vocabulary users already own. Everywhere else, soft rectangles.
- A field sits on a **section card** in a form, never floating on the bare
  rail.

### A stored value: mask dots, an eye, a copy — on the field

- The dots are a **placeholder**, never a value — fixed length, vanishing on
  the first keystroke, submittable by nothing.
- The verbs (eye, copy) sit inside the trailing edge, quiet at rest, lit on
  hover, with their room reserved so long values ellipsize behind them.
- A revealed value is display-only; it never reaches the form draft.
- **No eye for a value that is not there** — an empty box that adds one is an
  ordinary empty box with its own placeholder.

## Control choices that are already made

- **Mode switches** (2+ exclusive modes): the one segmented control. Snug
  track, near-edge-to-edge active fill, no drop shadow on the active chip.
- **Binary on/off**: the switch (track + sliding thumb), not a segmented
  pair.
- **Primary action**: unmistakably clickable — accent fill, white label,
  AA contrast or better. "This does not look like a button" is a design
  failure, stated as a rule.
- **Destructive verbs**: reversible by default. Bulk actions name their count
  ("Close 12 other tabs"). Offer Undo when restoration is real. Irreversible
  or consequential actions need an explicit review of the target and effect;
  never promise Undo for data that cannot be restored.

## Accepting a form change

Screenshot the rail before and after. The before/after pair is judged on:
partition proportions (§ Sidebars), the short-phrase rule, heading voice,
field alignment on the shared grid, and the pinned Save. A form change that
cannot show its before/after pair is not done.
