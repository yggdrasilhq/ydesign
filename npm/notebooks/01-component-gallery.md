# Component gallery

Every component an app may reach for, and the one-owner rule each encodes.
Below the prose, this page appends **live specimens** — real widgets painted
by the host — so the comparison against your own surface is a screenshot away.

The rule underneath the whole gallery: **one visual decision, one owner.**
Consumers consume. A surface that restyles a shared control is a second
encoding, and second encodings drift.

## yggui components (libyggterm · L1)

| Component | Purpose | The rule it owns |
|---|---|---|
| `conversation::*` | The agent-transcript-as-document: `ConversationColumn`, `UserTurn`, `AssistantTurn`, `WorkGroup`, `WorkRow`, `DiffStat`, `ChangedFileChips` | The only chat surface. A second hand-rolled transcript in any app is the bug this set exists to prevent |
| `prose::*` | The type system for rendered markdown: `ProseTokens::{document,conversation,rail}` | No host spells a face, size, leading or tracking of its own — change `prose.rs` first, then docs |
| `chat_input` | The composer: one rounded box, context upper-left, send lower-right | Host owns value/state; the box never self-clears |
| `chrome::TitlebarChrome` | Three-slot mirrored titlebar + window controls | Told a `SidebarEdge`; never decides a side itself — `ChromeOrientation` answers that |
| `rails::SideRailShell` | Docked or auto-hide side rail | Host owns the reveal state machine; geometry stamps are contract |
| `drag_tree` + `drag_visuals` | Headless tree drag-reorder + ghost/drop visuals | One drag grammar per window (`RowDragGesture`); thresholds are constants, not choices |
| `dpad::ScrollDpad` | 3×3 glass scroll pad for any scrolling surface | Host owns what the actions mean |
| `notifications::*` | Toast viewport, cards, tones, anchors | The anchor belongs to the viewport, not the toast |
| `pill_toolbar` | Floating translucent toolbar (find, steppers) costing no layout | Owns shape/material only — no state, ever |
| `split_button` | One sticky primary action + caret menu | Menu surface opaque; per-item accent allowed |
| `otp` | 6-cell code entry with native paste bridge | — |
| `motion` | Easing curves + durations | Motion is functional; desktop-fast, never rubbery |
| `theme` | Gradient-theme plumbing over `YgguiThemeSpec` | Stable path: no compositor blur, no alpha-only chrome |

## Schema widgets (a Tier A app declares; the host paints)

The chrome of every libyggterm app is a **wire schema**, not app-drawn DOM.
The vocabulary grows only when a second app needs a kind.

| Widget | Notes |
|---|---|
| `section` | Opt-in `card: true` wraps a **form** in the Settings card. A list is never a card |
| `label` | `muted` for notices and status lines |
| `list-row` | The shared row engine: `depth`/`expanded`/`expand_action` (trees), `reorder_action` (drag), `status` (`durable`/`transient` dot — the app names a class, the host owns the colour), `menu`, `rename`, `actions` |
| `tabs` | Renders on the one segmented control. Every mode switch is this, never a hand-rolled pill |
| `search-box`, `text-input`, `number-input` | Fields wear the ONE field skin. `text-input` adds `multiline`, `line_numbers`, `word_wrap`, `secret`, `stored`, `actions[]`, `value_key` |
| `toggle`, `button` | `footer` buttons honour `primary: true` — a form's Save is pinned, not scrolled |
| `markdown` | A page of emd, rendered through `yggui::prose` typography |

⭐ **Body vs bar on a document surface.** In the viewport, `markdown`,
`list-row` and editor widgets render in the BODY flow; every other kind
(`section`, `label`, `toggle`, `search-box`, `tabs`, `button`) paints into
the TOP BAR strip. This was caught by ydesign's own pixel proof — its first
exhibition page appended rail-style controls after the prose and they
squeezed into a horizontal bar above the page. A control that wants to sit
in a flow belongs in a rail pane, or as prose in a document.

## emd components (a ```emd fence carries JSON; the host renders)

`grid`, `panel`, `plot`, `sparkline`, `metric`, `query`, `datagrid`,
`agentfinding` — the analytical vocabulary. Contracts and authoring rules in
the **emd & notebooks** page. One taste rule here: a component carries an
`evidence` block because a number without provenance is decoration, not data.

## What belongs where — deciding in one minute

- Is it **prose, a table, a reading**? Markdown + emd components.
- Is it a **control or a status**? A schema widget.
- Is it the **app's own domain object** (a tab, a file, a notebook)? A
  `list-row` wearing the row engine.
- Is it a **new interaction no widget can answer**? First grow the schema
  vocabulary (Tier C: one new host widget, two consumers), and only when a
  foreign engine is truly required consider Tier B — and pay its tax
  knowingly (no faithful screenshots, no dom-eval, no inherited theme).

## The specimens below this prose

The appended block is *live*: real rows with their status slots. Rail-only
cards and toggles are not rendered in this document appendix. Screenshot this
page and compare your surface against it — same fonts, same tint, same row
anatomy. If yours disagrees, the fix belongs in the shared component, not in
your stylesheet.
