# Foundations — calm chrome, clear content

The shell should make work feel continuous. Its pale blue-grey base and faint
blue-to-green tint connect tabs and rails; an opaque reading surface gives
text a stable background. Save gradients for the surrounding workspace. The
content should not have to compete with a decorative backdrop.

## Semantic color, not a collection of hex values

Accent derives from the theme. It identifies selection, focus and a genuine
primary action. It is a limited attention resource: if every button is filled,
no button has priority. Separators use a quiet hairline; elevation explains a
temporary overlapping surface. A docked region needs neither a floating shadow
nor an extra card simply to exist.

The current exported status palette is durable green `#22c55e`, transient
blue `#3b82f6`, attention amber `#f59e0b`, and reserved-dead red `#ef4444`.
These values document npm/design-tokens.json; consumers ask the shared theme
for semantic tokens instead of copying literals. Color must be accompanied
by a label, icon state or other readable cue when it communicates a decision.

## Typography is a hierarchy of jobs

The exported interface family is Inter Variable; code uses JetBrains Mono.
The reading baseline is 16 px with 1.7 leading in a roughly 720 px column.
Use a narrow prose measure but let diagrams and component studies be large
enough to inspect. Do not shrink an entire application screenshot into a
postage stamp and call it an example: isolate the relevant region, retain
scale, and put the explanation next to it.

The inherited compact chrome currently uses 12 px rows and smaller metadata.
That is a recorded baseline, not proof of comfortable reading. The complex
sidebar study proposes larger two-line account rows and targets because the
user must distinguish identities, not merely scan short filenames. Verify
the actual font, scale, target geometry, focus and contrast before accepting
an app's density. App notebooks may define a different brand type hierarchy.

## Beauty follows relationships

Related objects align. A label sits near its control. A command belongs near
the object it changes. Repeated rows keep a stable rhythm, but unrelated
tasks do not inherit the same panel merely because that was easy to code.
Whitespace reveals groups; it does not fill a fixed-width toolbar by leaving
most of it empty. Icons share a stroke and optical weight, with a hit region
large enough that the user aims at a control rather than a tiny drawing.

Read the ribbon and complex-sidebar studies next. They apply these choices
to failures, retain what was useful, and state what still needs implementation.
